              Plato’s <i>Allegory of the Cave</i> in
              <i>The Republic Book VII</i> (375 B.C.) remains one of the most
              profound and enduring metaphors for <b>knowledge</b>,
              <b>enlightenment</b> and the <b>nature of reality</b>. In this
              allegory, Plato describes a scenario where prisoners are confined
              to a <b>dark cave</b> since birth and chained in such a way that
              they can only see an inner wall. As each day passes, shadows are
              cast upon this wall by objects and moving people behind them.
              Mistaking these shadows for reality, the prisoners accept them as
              the only truth they know.
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl scroll-swipe-left">
              One day, a prisoner breaks free from the chains and discover the
              true sources of the shadows. In doing so, this freed prisoner
              abandons their old, limited perspective. And when they return to
              the cave, they recognise the shadows as mere
              <b>reflections of the broader world</b>, to the dismay of the
              fellow prisoners who violently reject the new findings.
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl scroll-swipe-right">
              Although Plato originally used the <i>Cave Allegory</i> to
              describe his personal struggle to educate an ignorant and hostile
              Athenian public, it is equally a powerful
              <b>metaphor for scientific advancement</b>. The chained prisoners
              represent the general public who experience
              <b>surface appearances</b> of the world and are confined to
              partial truths shaped by <b>human limitations</b>. For example,
              people observe apples falling from trees without comprehending the
              forces invisible to the human eye: like gravity. The prisoner who
              breaks free are like scientists who attempt to reason and
              understand deeper truths that lie beyond the ordinary human
              perspective.

            Stanley Kubrick’s <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> presents science as
            the key for humanity to <b>escape</b> Plato’s cave of ignorance and
            limitation. The film’s opening Dawn of Man sequence acts as a

            >
            of Plato’s <i>Cave Allegory</i>, set in a prehistoric age when the
            first humans emerged. In this scene (shown in figure 7), Kubrick
            depicts the proto humans huddled fearfully inside a dark cave, an
            obvious
            <span

              >allusion</span
            >
            to the Platonic allegory. Like Plato’s prisoners, these early humans
            are bound by fear and ignorance, powerless before nature and rival
            tribes. However, after encountering an alien monolith, a higher
            order being or artefact, the proto humans discover how to wield a
            bone as a weapon which they use to defeat another tribe.

              to a spacecraft drifting in orbit (figure 6). Although the time
              between the two cuts is separated by millions of years, in
              completely different environments, the bone and the spacecraft
              <b>match graphically</b>. Through this iconic transition, Kubrick
              connects the bone (a prehistoric invention) to modern scientific
              advancements that have replaced it yet serve the same purpose:
              helping humans to navigate and explore the universe. In this
              sense, the cave of Plato’s allegory has <b>expanded outward</b>.
              Earth itself becomes the cave, while the vast cosmos represents
              the world outside.

            <p>
              Evidently, <i>2001</i> presents science as the means for humanity
              to escape our Earth-bound condition. The film’s spaceships
              symbolise the power of science not only as a means of transporting
              David Bowman to Jupiter but also to the Monolith. In doing so,
              Kubrick describes the <b>two-way relationship</b> between mankind
              and science.

              Humankind can advance science as seen in the aforementioned match
              cut, but science can in turn elevate humanity to more enlightened
              state. In this way, science becomes the vehicle that allows
              Plato’s prisoners to escape from their chained existence and
              search for greater meaning and knowledge beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, <i>2001</i> also subtly warns us about the misuse of
              science. Kubrick suggests that science when channelled through
              technology, is often used to
              <b>serve selfish human interests</b> rather than to uncover the
              deeper and greater truths about the universe.

                The misuse of science is captured by the famous shot where the

                Kubrick also suggests sciences’ role in <b>warfare</b>. Returning to
                the iconic cut from the bone to the spacecraft, in the Arthur C.
                Clarke novel, written alongside the film, suggests that though
                science has advanced, human aggression has remained unchanged.
                <b>“In a million years, the human race had lost few of its
                aggressive instincts; along symbolic lines visible only to
                politicians, the thirty-eight nuclear powers watched one another
                with belligerent anxiety.”</b> This detail, though unstated in the
                film, shows how science is ultimately used to serve
                <b>human aggression</b> rather than a means for enlightenment.

                Kubrick is clearly criticising science’s misuse during the
                <b>1960 Cold War era</b>, which saw the
                <b>proliferation of atomic weapons</b>. The Atomic Bomb itself
                shows how physics, a scientific discipline intended to uncover
                the laws of the universe was redirected to impose domination and
                fear. His criticism extends to
                <b>consumer culture of the 1960s</b>, where post-war scientific
                developments resulted in an explosion of household appliances
                such as television, microwaves and dishwashers (G. Cross 2000).
                Kubrick’s shot of the floating pen suggests that these
                inventions do little to advance our collective understanding.

            Andrei Tarkovsky’s <i>Solaris</i> (1972) is a direct response to
            Kubrick’s <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>. <i>Solaris</i> follows
            psychologist Kris Kelvin who travels to a space station orbiting the
            mysterious planet called <i>Solaris</i>. As the scientists attempt
            to uncover Solaris’ mystery, the planet’s ocean confronts them with
            physical manifestations of their memories.

            Tarkovsky’s <i>Solaris</i> offers a scathing critique of
            <i>2001’s</i> view that proposes science as the path to
            transcendence. Whereas Kubrick’s film looks outward, suggesting that
            enlightenment lies amongst the stars, Tarkovsky turns inward. True
            enlightenment, Tarkovsky suggests, can only be achieved through deep
            self-reflection and not through scientific progress.

            Tarkovsky begins his critique by attacking the centrepiece of
            <i>2001’s</i> thesis: Kubrick’s iconic match cut. Whereas
            <i>2001’s</i> match cut leaps instantly from prehistory to the space
            age, Kris Kelvin’s journey to the Solaris space station is drawn out
            (figure 10). His trip to the space station involves a
            <b>5-minute bus ride</b> through congested city traffic. Tarkovsky’s
            visual metaphor argues that scientific advancement is
            <b>not a clear, linear leap forward</b>, but a
            <b>slow, messy process</b> filled with obstacles and danger. This
            criticism is true as science is never straightforward, but instead
            depends on guesswork, experimentation, and constant revision. Thomas
            Kuhn, a historian and philosopher, argues in
            <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i> (1962) that
            scientific breakthroughs are
            <b

              activity of normal science.”</b

            Newtonian physics, for example, was later challenged by Einstein’s

                This criticism is furthered by the films’ depiction of the
                <b>spaceship</b>, which runs counterpoint to the spacecraft in
                <i>2001</i>. Kubrick’s choice to use the
                <i>Blue Danube</i> waltz (figure 11) evokes the

                stars. Meanwhile, in <i>Solaris</i>, the spaceship is depicted
                as cold, sterile, and hostile to human life, as shown in Kris
                Kelvin’s room onboard the space station (figure 12). Moreover,
                the scientific research conducted on the space station yields no
                results. The planet’s mysterious abilities remain unsolved.
                Through this, <i>Solaris</i> criticises the space race between
                the Soviet Union and the United States, suggesting that both
                superpowers are pouring vast resources into exploring an
                inhospitable void.

            In <i>Solaris</i>, the Platonic higher being beyond the cave takes
            the form of the planet itself, subverting usual depictions of
            extraterrestrial beings. However, any attempt at communication with
            this higher intelligence proves impossible. The planet resurrects
            Khari (figure 13), Kris Kelvin’s former lover who died tragically.
            Yet she is recreated only from Kelvin’s own flawed and incomplete
            memories. Through this, Tarkovsky suggests that even when faced with
            a higher reality, humans remain
            <b>bound by their own limitations</b>. Our flawed memories cannot
            perfectly replicate reality, which prevents true understanding or
            meaningful connection with the higher beings like the monolith or
            Solaris. Khari remains a shadow, an imperfect copy that cannot
            bridge the gap between Solaris and Kris Kelvin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clearly, Tarkovsky is arguing that science is <b>not</b> the
            liberating force in the Platonic cave allegory. He portrays science
            as messy and incomplete, often only a half-truth, and condemns space
            travel as inhospitable. Furthermore, scientific advancement in space
            travel cannot lead us to higher beings because our flawed human
            perspective cannot grasp the greater truths embodied by the ‘higher
            beings.’ In fact, Tarkovsky suggests that the state of ignorance,
            like the prisoners inside the cave, is not completely undesirable.
            When asked about the mysteries of happiness, death and love in the
            final act, Kelvin responds:
            <b
              >“Not knowing this day [of your death] is what makes us
              immortal.”</b
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Tarkovsky’s message resonates with modern audiences. The image taken
            from the

            with humanity’s insignificance in the vast, empty universe (NASA
            2025). Perhaps, Tarkovsky suggests, it is be better to be ignorant
            of these overwhelming truths to preserve our fragile sense of
            wonder, hope and meaning.

            Villeneuve suggests that hard sciences like Mathematics and Physics
            alone cannot fill the divide between humanity and these “higher
            beings.” This is represented through the Ian Donnelly character, a
            physicist who fails to decode the alien’s mysterious language.
            Instead, Villeneuve foregrounds the <b>Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis</b>, a
            theory that proposes that <b>language shapes thought</b>. In the
            end, it is Dr. Louise Banks, a professor of linguistics that decodes
            the alien’s language, and by understanding their language, able to
            shape her own thought.

            The human limitation of linear time perception is illustrated by the
            film’s <b>subversion of the beleaguered mother trope</b>. Throughout
            the film, we are shown memories of Banks’ dead child (figure 17). We
            as the audience assume these memories to be flashbacks because of
            our own linear understanding of time. Later, it is revealed that
            these flashbacks are actually flash forwards in time, depicting her
            future child with Ian that will tragically die young. Despite the
            Heptapods warning her about her bleak future, Banks still embraces
            his life with Ian. This is reflected by her name for her daughter,
            “Hannah” which is a

                This films central misunderstanding demonstrates the shift from
                the prisoners of the cave to the enlightened thinkers. The
                Heptapods’ offer to share their language is misinterpreted as
                “Offer weapon” causing fear among world leaders much like
                Plato’s prisoners who are initially hostile to the returning
                prisoner. The Chinese commander, General Shang breaks
                negotiations and then attacks the alien vessel. Yet ironically
                it is the alien’s language that becomes the means of
                reconciliation. Banks, armed with ability to see forward in time
                is able to convince Shang to call off the attack by relaying to
                him the last words of his late wife. In this way, Banks, like
                the freed prisoner returning to the cave, uses her expanded
                vision to guide the prisoners to a greater truth. The
                transformative power of linguistics is summarised by General
                Shang’s final confession to Banks (figure 17):
                <b
                  >“You changed my mind. In a way, you are the reason for the
                  unification.”</b

                Villeneuve’s Arrival is thus aligned to Kubrick’s <i>2001</i>.
                Science can transform humanity into higher states of being by
                facilitating contact with advanced alien beings. However, unlike
                <i>2001</i> which looks outward to the frontiers of space
                travel, Villeneuve argues that it is the science of language
                that fosters understanding with these higher beings, and is
                ultimately responsible for enlightenment.

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>
              Plato’s <i>Cave Allegory</i> continues to resonate with modern
              audiences because it captures the timeless struggle for truth in a
              vast, uncaring universe. <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> presents
              science as the tool for truth seeking that can elevate humanity.
              <i>Solaris</i> challenges this view, revealing the limits of
              scientific understanding and the subjectivity of the human
              experience. <i>Arrival</i> offers a middle ground, suggesting that
              true enlightenment may come not just from scientific developments
              in space travel, but from the scientific study of languages and
