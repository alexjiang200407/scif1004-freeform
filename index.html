              Plato’s Allegory of the Cave in The Republic Book VII (375 B.C.)
              remains one of the most profound and enduring metaphors for
              knowledge, enlightenment and the nature of reality. In this
              allegory, Plato presents a scenario where prisoners are confined
              to a dark cave since birth and chained in such a way that they can
              only see an inner wall. As each day passes, shadows are cast upon
              this wall by objects and moving people behind them. Mistaking
              these shadows for reality, the prisoners accept them as the only
              truth they know. One day, a prisoner breaks free from the chains
              and discover the true sources of the shadows. In doing so, this
              freed prisoner abandons their old, limited perspective. And when
              they return to the cave, they recognise the shadows as mere
              reflections of the broader world, to the dismay of the fellow
              prisoners who violently reject his new findings.
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl">
              Although Plato originally used the Cave Allegory to describe his
              personal struggle to educate an ignorant and hostile Athenian
              public, it is equally a powerful metaphor describing scientific
              advancement. The chained prisoners represent the general public
              who experience surface appearances of the world and are confined
              to partial truths shaped by human limitations. For example, people
              observe apples falling from trees without comprehending the
              invisible forces like gravity. The prisoner who breaks free are
              like scientists who attempt to reason and understand deeper truths
              that lie beyond the ordinary human perspective.

                  It is then no accident that Plato’s conclusions in Cave

              In this feature article, we will discuss two of the most
              influential sci-fi films of all time: Solaris (1972) and 2001 A
              Space Odyssey (1968). Both films grapple with the ideas presented
              by Plato’s Cave allegory but take opposite perspectives. While
              2001 suggests that science and technology are essential steps for
              humanity to break its chains and reach higher truths, Solaris
              warns that even when we escape the cave, we may find that our own
              limitations and doubts elude us.

              Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) presents a complex
              and balanced perspective on science and its relationship with
              humanity. Kubrick suggests that while science itself may not be
              the ultimate form of truth it remains a vital tool to propel
              humanity towards greater knowledge and higher states of being.

                Kubrick draws on Plato’s Cave Allegory as a metaphor for
                humanity’s collective evolution. This idea is vividly
                illustrated in the film’s opening Dawn of Man sequence which
                depicts a pre-historic age supposedly when the first humans
                arose. In this scene, Kubrick depicts the proto humans huddled
                fearfully inside a cave, an obvious allusion to the Platonic
                prisoners of the cave. Like Plato’s prisoners, these early
                humans are bound by fear and ignorance, powerless before nature
                and rival tribes. However, after encountering an alien monolith,
                a symbol of the greater world outside the cave, the proto humans
                discover how to wield a bone as a weapon which they use to
                defeat another tribe.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="one-half">
              <p>
                In a moment of triumph, the proto human flings the bone into the
                air, and Kubrick match cuts to a spacecraft drifting in orbit.
                Although the time between the two cuts is separated by millions
                of years, in completely different environments, the bone and the
                spacecraft match graphically. Through this iconic transition,
                Kubrick connects the bone (a prehistoric invention) to modern
                scientific advancements that have replaced it yet serve the same
                purpose: helping humans to navigate and explore the universe. In
                this sense, the cave of Plato’s allegory has expanded outward.
                Earth itself becomes the cave, while the vast cosmos represents
                the world outside.
              </p>
              <p>
                As you can see. Although 2001 argues for leaving the cave,
                however it also criticises how humanity applies science through
                technology. Instead, he calls for humanity to use science as a
                vessel to uncover the deeper and greater truths of the universe.

            <p>
              2001 presents a world where scientific progress has far outpaced
              human development. Throughout the film, Kubrick highlights
              humanity’s insignificance compared to its own monumental
              scientific and technological creations, by visually dwarfing the
              astronauts against vast, imposing spacecraft. However, the
              humanity’s smallness isn’t just physical but also intellectual
              embodied by HAL9000 the spaceship’s artificial intelligence (AI).

                  HAL9000 is by far the most ‘human’ character in the movie
                  possessing a fear of death, emotions, deception, complications
                  and is the one forced to make ethical choices. This is
                  contrast to the cold and machine-like human astronauts.
                  Kubrick’s use of a fisheye lens in HAL’s point-of-view shots
                  further emphasizes humanity’s intellectual smallness within
                  its own technological domain.

                  Indeed, in 2001 it is machines that are striving for knowledge
                  and understanding, while humanity remains passive operators of
                  these tools. It is only when David Bowman the last surviving
                  astronaut disconnects HAL’s brain that he is able to transcend
                  and morph into a higher being.

                  Kubrick’s concerns are extremely relevant today, with the 21st
                  century’s relentless push toward automation and artificial
                  intelligence, products of scientific advancement. In THE RISKS
                  OF HUMAN OVERRELIANCE ON LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CRITICAL
                  THINKING, AI researchers Dueneus and Ruiz examine how
                  excessive dependence on AI tools can undermine human cognition
                  and critical thought. The paper argues that the overreliance
                  on these tools can cause “cognitive atrophy” and “exacerbate
                  existing inequalities and create new forms of cognitive
                  divide.”

                    primitive drawing. The use of a fisheye lens evokes HAL’s
                    wide, panoramic vision, in contrast to the human eye.
