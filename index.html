          It is the task of the enlightened not only to ascend to learning and

          having or not. And this they must do, even with the prospect of death.

              Born on the island of Kauai, Hawai‘i, in 1921 as a
              Japanese-American Nisei, S. Neil Fujita’s journey to devote
              himself to art and design began when he sailed out of his home.
              His portfolio is rich in colors—starting a design department for
              Columbia Records, creating jazz album covers, movie titles, book
              covers, painting, writing, and teaching at top design schools.
              That journey was not so easy, though. Like many other
              Japanese-Americans, his life was disrupted by World War 2 and the
              issue of Executive Order 9066. While these events do not look to
              overshadow his prolific portfolio, his works reflect Fujita’s
              resilience and fearlessness.
