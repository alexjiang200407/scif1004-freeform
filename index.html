              Plato’s Allegory of the Cave in The Republic Book VII (375 B.C.)
              remains one of the most profound and enduring metaphors for
              knowledge, enlightenment and the nature of reality. In this
              allegory, Plato presents a scenario where prisoners are confined
              to a dark cave since birth and chained in such a way that they can
              only see an inner wall. As each day passes, shadows are cast upon
              this wall by objects and moving people behind them. Mistaking
              these shadows for reality, the prisoners accept them as the only
              truth they know. One day, a prisoner breaks free from the chains
              and discover the true sources of the shadows. In doing so, this
              freed prisoner abandons their old, limited perspective. And when
              they return to the cave, they recognise the shadows as mere
              reflections of the broader world, to the dismay of the fellow
              prisoners who violently reject his new findings.
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl scroll-swipe-right">
              Although Plato originally used the Cave Allegory to describe his
              personal struggle to educate an ignorant and hostile Athenian
              public, it is equally a powerful metaphor describing scientific
              advancement. The chained prisoners represent the general public
              who experience surface appearances of the world and are confined
              to partial truths shaped by human limitations. For example, people
              observe apples falling from trees without comprehending the
              invisible forces like gravity. The prisoner who breaks free are
              like scientists who attempt to reason and understand deeper truths
              that lie beyond the ordinary human perspective.

              In this feature article, we will discuss two of the most
              influential sci-fi films of all time: Solaris (1972) and 2001 A
              Space Odyssey (1968). Both films grapple with the ideas presented
              by Plato’s Cave allegory but take opposite perspectives. While
              2001 suggests that science and technology are essential steps for
              humanity to break its chains and reach higher truths, Solaris
              warns that even when we escape the cave, we may find that our own
              limitations and doubts elude us.

              Kubrick draws on Plato’s Cave Allegory as a metaphor for
              humanity’s collective evolution. This idea is vividly illustrated
              in the film’s opening Dawn of Man sequence which depicts a
              pre-historic age supposedly when the first humans arose. In this
              scene, Kubrick depicts the proto humans huddled fearfully inside a
              cave, an obvious allusion to the Platonic prisoners of the cave.
              Like Plato’s prisoners, these early humans are bound by fear and
              ignorance, powerless before nature and rival tribes. However,
              after encountering an alien monolith, a symbol of the greater
              world outside the cave, the proto humans discover how to wield a
              bone as a weapon which they use to defeat another tribe.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="one-half">
            <p>
              In a moment of triumph, the proto human flings the bone into the
              air, and Kubrick match cuts to a spacecraft drifting in orbit.
              Although the time between the two cuts is separated by millions of
              years, in completely different environments, the bone and the
              spacecraft match graphically. Through this iconic transition,
              Kubrick connects the bone (a prehistoric invention) to modern
              scientific advancements that have replaced it yet serve the same
              purpose: helping humans to navigate and explore the universe. In
              this sense, the cave of Plato’s allegory has expanded outward.
              Earth itself becomes the cave, while the vast cosmos represents
              the world outside.
            </p>
            <p>
              As you can see. Although 2001 argues for leaving the cave, however
              it also criticises how humanity applies science through
              technology. Instead, he calls for humanity to use science as a
              vessel to uncover the deeper and greater truths of the universe.

          <h2>Scientific advancement renders human truth seeking obsolete</h2>
          <p>
            2001 presents a world where scientific progress has far outpaced
            human development. Throughout the film, Kubrick highlights
            humanity’s insignificance compared to its own monumental scientific
            and technological creations, by visually dwarfing the astronauts
            against vast, imposing spacecraft. However, the humanity’s smallness
            isn’t just physical but also intellectual embodied by HAL9000 the
            spaceship’s artificial intelligence (AI).

              Figure 8: HAL9000 is shown in this famous shot. The centred red

              <p>
                HAL9000 is by far the most ‘human’ character in the movie
                possessing a fear of death, emotions, deception, complications
                and is the one forced to make ethical choices. This is contrast
                to the cold and machine-like human astronauts. Kubrick’s use of
                a fisheye lens in HAL’s point-of-view shots further emphasizes
                humanity’s intellectual smallness within its own technological
                domain.
              </p>
              <p>
                Indeed, in 2001 it is machines that are striving for knowledge
                and understanding, while humanity remains passive operators of
                these tools. It is only when David Bowman the last surviving
                astronaut disconnects HAL’s brain that he is able to transcend
                and morph into a higher being.

                Kubrick’s concerns are extremely relevant today, with the 21st
                century’s relentless push toward automation and artificial
                intelligence, products of scientific advancement. In THE RISKS

                dependence on AI tools can undermine human cognition and
                critical thought. The paper argues that the overreliance on
                these tools can cause “cognitive atrophy” and “exacerbate
                existing inequalities and create new forms of cognitive divide.”

            Additionally, Kubrick suggests that science when channelled through
            technology, is often used to serve selfish human interests rather
            than uncover the deeper and greater truths about the universe.
            Returning to the iconic cut from the bone to the spacecraft, in the
            Arthur C. Clarke novel, written alongside the film, the orbiting
            spacecraft is a nuclear weapon. This detail, though unstated in the
            film, shows how science is ultimately used as a means of domination
            and intimidation rather than a means for enlightenment.

                This idea is further reinforced by the famous shot where the pen
                glides wistfully in mid-air (figure 10). Kubrick uses the sharp
                focus and central framing to draw the audience’s focus to the
                pen: a symbol of humanity’s pursuit of knowledge, reason and
                enlightenment. Yet the pen is unmoored from the passenger’s hand
                who sits in the background, absorbed by the video screen. The
                dramatic irony between the pen’s clear prominence and the
                passenger’s ignorance of it suggests that science can be applied
                to satisfy human comfort and complacency rather than to advance
                our understanding.

                Kubrick is clearly criticising science’s misuse during the 1960
                Cold War era, which saw the proliferation of atomic weapons. The
                Atomic Bomb itself shows how physics, a scientific discipline
                intended to uncover the laws of the universe was redirected to
                impose domination and fear. His criticism extends to consumer
                culture of the 1960s, where post-war scientific developments
                resulted in an explosion of household appliances such as
                television, microwaves and dishwashers (G. Cross 2000).
                Kubrick’s shot of the floating pen suggests that these
                inventions do little to advance our collective understanding.

                  developments fueled the commercialization of everyday
                  products. Items like the lawnmower, motorboat, and barbecue
                  grill represent the era’s expanding consumer culture and
                  suburban lifestyle.

          <h2>The Hope for Science</h2>
          <p>
            However, Kubrick does not state that science is useless. After all,
            it is the Jupiter space mission that is caused by science that
            allows Bowman to reach the monolith and evolve. The importance of
            science is clearly illustrated in scenes where we are introduced to
            the spaceships. The Blue Danube classical score evokes a sense of
            awe and sublimity. The spaceship itself is a metaphor for the vessel
            that transports Bowman from his earth-bound humanity, suggesting the
            importance of science in transporting us between the two states in
            Plato’s cave allegory. 2001 is ultimately hopeful as the final image
            the rebirth of Bowman as the Star Child suggests that scientific
            exploration can be the gateway to an evolutionary leap.
